Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**SystemOwned** | **bool** | Indicates system owned resource | [optional] [default to null]
**DisplayName** | **string** | Defaults to ID if not set | [optional] [default to null]
**Description** | **string** | Description of this resource | [optional] [default to null]
**Tags** | [**[]Tag**](Tag.md) | Opaque identifiers meaningful to the API user | [optional] [default to null]
**CreateUser** | **string** | ID of the user who created this resource | [optional] [default to null]
**Protection** | **string** | Protection status is one of the following: PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is not allowed             to modify it. NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite&#x3D;true. UNKNOWN - the _protection field could not be determined for this           entity.  | [optional] [default to null]
**CreateTime** | **int64** | Timestamp of resource creation | [optional] [default to null]
**LastModifiedTime** | **int64** | Timestamp of last modification | [optional] [default to null]
**LastModifiedUser** | **string** | ID of the user who last modified this resource | [optional] [default to null]
**Id** | **string** | Unique identifier of this resource | [optional] [default to null]
**ResourceType** | **string** | An application profile can be bound to a virtual server to specify the application protocol characteristics. It is used to influence how load balancing is performed. Currently, three types of application profiles are supported: LbFastTCPProfile, LbFastUDPProfile and LbHttpProfile. LbFastTCPProfile or LbFastUDPProfile is typically used when the application is using a custom protocol or a standard protocol not supported by the load balancer. It is also used in cases where the user only wants L4 load balancing mainly because L4 load balancing has much higher performance and scalability, and/or supports connection mirroring. LbHttpProfile is used for both HTTP and HTTPS applications. Though application rules, if bound to the virtual server, can be used to accomplish the same goal, LbHttpProfile is intended to simplify enabling certain common use cases.  | [default to null]
